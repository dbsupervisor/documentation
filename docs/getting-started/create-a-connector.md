# Create a connector

In order to have your database activity and health reported to DBSupervisor for analysis, you'll need to create a connector through the [dashboard](https://dashboard.dbsupervisor.com).

If you've just created a new organization, you'll be prompted to create your first connector when visiting the _Health checks_ tool. Alternatively, you can navigate to _Settings -> Connectors_ to:

- Create new connectors
- Archive existing connectors
- View setup instructions for existing connectors

When creating a new connector, you'll be asked for a friendly name (e.g., _Production database_) to identify the connector in future. You'll then be provided with the setup commands which you'll need in order to [run the connector](./run-the-connector) in your environment.
