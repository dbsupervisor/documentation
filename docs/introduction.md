# Introduction

DBSupervisor monitors your database health and activity, and provides you with alerts and insights to keep your application running smoothly. The two main components of DBSupervisor are:

- A web-based [dashboard](https://dashboard.dbsupervisor.com) to view your database health at a glance, track issues, and tweak alert thresholds.
- The [open-source connector](https://github.com/dbsupervisor/connector), which runs as a standalone application within your network/VPC. The connector is responsible for interacting with your database and securely reporting metadata back to DBSupervisor.
